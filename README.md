# yelp-camp
Yelp Camp is a web application used to discover new Campgrounds available for all those Campers out there.
This application shows different great places to get you interested and hop on to one of those great locations.
Check those comments for each campground before you go there to make sure it suits your taste.


So what are you waiting for? 
Check it out here and let me know how it looks in action (ignore any styling issues, because I will be fixing them whenever I find time).

Unbox my 'Project' folder to expand all the files, I used (committed a complete Project folder than individual files to make them look isolated from readme and license files)

Go to your browser and type this to take a loot at my work: URL -https://kiran-kumar-apps.herokuapp.com/ (yeah also works if you just click the url).
